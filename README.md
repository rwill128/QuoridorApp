TODO: Training mode:
1.) Shortest path is highlighted and counted for each player
2.) The "profit" in terms of increased minimum path length 
   for the opponent - increased path length for you, is displayed
3.) Heat map of good/bad moves considered my AI during MCTS

4.) Add proper movement rules for skipping over opponent. Maybe make it a toggle.
5.) Add a check to make sure the path isn't completely blocked for either player. 
Basically a legality check for wall placement

6.) Optimize!
